# Spam-classification-model-in-ML
About Building a iOS Application using Apple's Core ML Framework, we will builed a Linear SVC model using sklearn library on the SMS Data, users will type a message on their iPhone and our model will then identify whether the message is a Spam or a Ham (Not spam).


Spam-Classifier-iOS-Application-CoreML-Linear-SVC

Building a iOS Application using Apple's Core ML Framework. A Linear SVC model is build using sklearn library with python on the SMS Data that contains Spams and Hams messages and their classification. The application will take message as input from the text box and when user taps the button it will identify and show the appropirate message whether it is a Spam or Ham accordingly. "SpamClassifier.mlmodel" is the name of the coreml model.
